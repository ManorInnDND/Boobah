			</p>
				<section id="session9">
					<h3>Session 9: Octopus (Squid) Cult and Mirabarran Reentry</h3>
					<p class="dm"><strong>DM:    </strong>Wyatt</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The party decides to return to Mirabar with Obolo and and hopefully get Broglyn to fund a 
						return trip to save Obolo's people. Before setting sail a corpse rises from amid the dead 
						sailors on the boat and demands Obolo come serve the mighty mage Frostberg, in exchange
						Frostberg will tell Obolo about his people. The party convinces Obolo to decline and 
						the corpse deanimates, plummeting into the river.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Sailing is smooth, with Dothmar manning the ship and directing the efforts of the 
						untrained party. As they near Mirabar however a cult of Octopus-worshipping dwarves
						attack the party, striking Yugio with a lightining bolt. A brief battle later the 
						cultists are dead, except for their leader who is interrogated and who yields little 
						information except that he servese the dread "<span class="npc">Druklin-Dulin</span>". During
						the battle the cultists had demanded 8 offerings, during the interrogation Qautlz asks for 
						clarification on what an offering is and learns that "Anything that sinks" would have been
						worthy. The party then decides to make an offering of this priest by Yugio conjuring a brick
						and tying it to him, Dothmar kicking him unconcious, Guinesse poking at his strange tattoo, general 
						abuse from Qautlz and Coen. Basically he is abused by everyone in the party except Helm before being 
						cast overboard. 
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Arriving at the small docks of Mirabar the party is boarded by an inspector who is dismayed
						to hear from Captain Dothmar (disguised as a non-Dothmar looking dwarf) that the "The crew is dead... we didn't do it!" Silence and confused
						answers lead this inspector, named Valdrin, to arrest the party for questioning. Fortunately
						Qatzl, who had also disguised himself and taken the Common Dwarf name Gimli Hardhammer had sent 
						word to Broglyn asking for a representive to get the party out of the inevitable jam they would find themselves
						in when reaching the docks. This representative arrives, an oily dwarf named Julio, and who gets the party
						to head off the ship and toward the jail, promising they are not going to be hassled much, he does this AFTER
						ensuring the the chests of weapons from Grundl are on the boat.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">On the way to the jail Quatzl awaits for a crowd to show  up and misty steps away, then
						returns in his normal form and the frustrated Valdrin lets the whole party go, warning that they are not
						to leave the city without his consent. Julio then takes the party down into the Undercity and 
						then to Broglyn's apartments.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Under the judging eyes of Broglyn's goons the party waits for an audience with Broglyn... how will 
						things go?
					</p>
					
				</section> 
				<section id="session8">
					<h3>Session 8: Dothmar's Fever Dream?</h3> 
					<p class="dm"><strong>DM:    </strong>Courtney</p>
					<p class="Core">
						A strange tale this time, the party finds themselves on the ocean and nearly out of food and water.
						They have just spotted land after months of water and are overjoyed! 
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Landing at once with expert sailer checks the group walks on the beach searching for food. A giant crab attacks 
						and provides an abundance of crab meat for the weary sailors. The party also spots a monkey in the jungle with
						monstrously sized trees that abuts the beach. After eating crab the party enters the jungle and the brave 
						Duradin approaches too close to the river and is abruptly attacked by a 30' land shark of uncertain anatomy (legs? fins?).
						Ten sea horses also leap back and forth from the river to the bank and harass the party while  they fight the shark.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The shark takes a large bite out of Duradin, who takes a beating from all the strange ocean-like river creatures that 
						seem intent on ending his life. Fortunately his allies help kill the shark and sea horses with arrows, axes, magic, and 
						more axes.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The party returns to the ship with fresh water and shark meat. After a long debate it is decided to return to the jungle 
						the following day.  On this day they come to a fork in the path that runs alongside the river, and choosing the left path
						come to a 100' tall wall. Debating if the wall was constructed by monkey-folk the party ventures around the side and see
						to their surprise 2 elven guards.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Hailing the guards the party learns that the city is very friendly and is an ancient safe place on this floating 
						mud 'island' that rests on a thin layer of earth and floats around the sea. That's why the sea monsters were in the river, 
						the ocean is right underneath!
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Entering the town and looking for a good time for Dothmar the group travels to the shady part of town, blowing off the
						guards who ask the party to stop at the town hall and register before exploring. The party spot is mediocre and Dothmar
						looks for a more fun experience, and is informed that a drug dealer will come in around 2 am.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The party waits it out and a awkward kid who looks like Eminem that no one thinks is cool except himself enters and 
						shyly offers the group a late night drinking soda. Frustrated the party finally learns from him that a group of 
						hard-core party people live out in the jungle and do drugs with their warrior friends keeping them mostly safe From
						death. Jumping at this opportunity the party follows the gangster outside the city wall after a tense moment with town 
						guard. 
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						As soon as they are in the jungle the party is attacked by bandits! Where are the goddam drugs? 
						Find out next time, maybe.
					</p>

					<h3>Session 7: Polar Bears, Here? </h3>
					<p class="dm"><strong>DM:    </strong>Courtney</p>
					<p class='Core'>
						The group kills 6 polar bears and has a dope time. They make it back to the shpi and Yugio spends the rest of the 
						session dislodging the the tree from the side of the boat by casting remove earth repeatedly. He also casts mold earth
						to kindly craft clay limbs for the quadraplegic sailor.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="session6">
					<h3>Session 6: Krushing Krang's Gang</h3>
					<p class="dm"><strong>DM:    </strong>Wyatt</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Heading south to the trade boat Dothmar notices a fellow dwarf impaled on the front of the boat. 
						Guinesie and Yugio investigate while the rest of the party convinces Redbeard not to blow their 
						cover. The boat has more slain dwarves on deck, apparently squashed, a dwarf limb has been used
						as a writing tool for scrawling out the name "Krang Gang" in giant.  A tree has been pushed over 
						onto the boat and tracks of gnolls, a giant, some ogres, and several chests can be seen moving 
						away into the forest. The party debates for a time before heading onto the boat and finding one of the 
						dwarves is still alive. Helm revives him but he is in shock. Below decks the companions learn
						that 4 of their 8 chests of goods have been stolen!
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Opting to pursue the the theives the party travels into the forest. Soon they come upon the mashed bodies of 
						4 gnolls, a chest of loot, and one dead ogre. They hide the chest and continue following the tracks. 
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Reaching the base of a gentle slope the group catches wind of a foul odor, and is certain the theives
						are nearby. Reconnaissance reveals two ogres and a hill giant gathered around a gnoll roasting over 
						a fire. The party then plans a "flanking" manuever and charge down upon the monsters, slaying them 
						without much trouble.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The party has now recovered all the stolen chests, but they must get them back to the ship... or 
						maybe they'll do something else - who can tell? We'll find out next session!
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="session5">
					<h3>Session 5: Meeting Obolo</h3>
					<p class="dm"><strong>DM:    </strong>Wyatt</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Yugio hopes to find tresure amongst the toads but decides against digging through the shit pit
						where they disgorge all the undigestables they consume. A blue skinned orc claw his way out of one of the slain 
						toads and introduces himself as <span class="npc">Obolo</span>, cheif of Grundl. The companions speak with
						him and convince him to return to Grundl with them.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						On the way out of the chasm an albino raven with an petulent female blue orc head lands above the party and heckles them.
						Her taunting reveals that she is Obolo's sister, <span class="npc">Witchita</span>, and that she is appentice to local 
						sorcerer name <span class="npc">Frostberg</span>.  Guinesie and Qautlz quickly tire of her boasting and blast her. She flees 
						and shortly after a bizzare jellyfish-like floating creature attacks the party, badly wounding Qatzl before being destroyed.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Getting back to town is easy with Obolo as a guide, and the party discovers that the town is deserted - except for 
						several ogre and gnoll maruaders and an insane Findl. Yugio releases Findl from his cell and watches as he rushes 
						out of town and onto the ledge. In a panic Findl cries out that he has "missed the great migration, no, never, there
						is still time!", then Findl leaps from the ledge and plunges to his death in the river below.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Back outside of town the group exchanges some telegrams with an irate <span class="npc">Broglin</span> who wants 
						mentions that the trade boat is docked an hour south of town.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="session4">
					<h3>Session 4: Toad Trouble</h3>
					<p class="dm"><strong>DM:    </strong>Wyatt</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Just outside of town, surrounded by the mob of raptururous villagers, the party decides the best thing to do is leave to look 
						for Obolo. Before leaving Yugio wants to see Malfred naked and skillfully rips away his clothing - there is little to see 
						however. Qautlz then throws down a leaf that sprouts into a massive oak, sending Malfred up into the air of its branches.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Redbeard Bronzebeard is able to lead the party to the chasm of the ice toads. Coen take the form of a small ice toad 
						and enters the cave but chokes when one of the 8 toads in the cave abruptly asks her "What Tribe?". A battle ensues with Coen
						being nearly killed by the toad bites, and Yugio being breifly consumed.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						After the fray, with the toads all slain, the companions notice the mightest of the toads is still moving. Someone appears to 
						be crawling out of its mouth!
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="session3">
					<h3>Session 3: Assisting Malfred</h3>
					<p class="dm"><strong>DM:    </strong>Wyatt</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Traveling out to the promontory where Malfred asked them to go, the companions witness the orc incanting. Soon a wrathful water elemental
						is summoned and the party begrudgingly aids him against it. As soon as the elemental is destroyed another composed of air takes its place,
						and then one of earth, and finally one of fire. With these four forces destroyed Malfred thanks the party and asks them to return with him
						as heroes to Grundl.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						A crowd of fifty orcish tradespeople meet the party and Malfred a quarter mile outside of town and Malfred introduces the party to the crowd
						favorably. The faces of the assembled townfolk are eerily blissful. The party is uneasy.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="session2">
					<h3>Session 2: Who's Who in Grundl</h3>
					<p class="dm"><strong>DM:    </strong>Wyatt</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The party meets with several local VIP's including <span class="npc">Findl</span>, the towns gnomish burgomeister and head 
						of finance; <span class="npc">Malfred</span>, a charismatic orc seeking to free the town's working class from the oppression 
						of Findl. They also learn about the town's absent cheif, <span class="npc">Obolo</span>, who is currently out meditating
						with toads. This is soon taken to mean "frolicking in the forest" by the party.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						During the exchange of seafood for Grundl's arms and armor a crate of sea urchins is discovered missing. The party 
						bullies one of the ship workers to find out a local chef is planning to create a delicious meal out of them. Traveling
						to the home of the chef the party is surprised by him leaping out of a window - but they soon capture him and recover almost
						all of the urchins.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The group then decides to visit Malfred on the following day to witness his miracle of nature outside of town.
					</p>

					<h3>Session 1: Reaching Grundl</h3>
					<p class="dm"><strong>DM:    </strong>Wyatt</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The companions have beat down the hobgoblins that attacked the ship and continue along the River Surbin toward <span class="location">Grundl</span>,
						town of unusually industrious orcs. A few days later the river becomes partially frozen and two <span class="npc">Yeti</span> leap from
						a neaby tree into the boat. One yeti is a red-bellied and the other is blue-bellied. The party murders them both and harvests them for 
						craklins, horn aphrodisiacs, and fur. Qatzl sells the captain of the ship some urine as an aphrodisiac.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Arriving in Grundl, the companions find board at <span class="location">Curler's Inn</span>, where they meet a drunken dwarf named
						Redbeard Bronzebeard as well as Curlers. The orc proprietor missing one of two lower tusks (the remaining tusk has a fine curl). 
						Dothmar attempts to seduce a cloaked female and is viciously stabbed by her. The companions attack her until she lays dead and discover
						she is terribly scarred and her lips are sewn shut.
