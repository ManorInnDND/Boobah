			</p>
			<section>session14
				<h3>Session 14: Trip to Lurkwood I</h3>
				<p class="Core">
					The crew makes Dothmar collect the 15 silvered weapons and head to the surface of Mirabar
					to obtain their wagon for the trip. Before heading to the coachhouse they stop at a magic 
					and potion shop. Dothmar buys a Love Potion from Freezie, the gnome proprietor. Quatzl 
					buys a potion of lesser restoration, and exchanges urine (potion of thirst quenching) for 
					a sample of Dream Aid. Meanwhile Helm buys shield of arrow catching, a map to a tomb of a long
					dead cleric in the Anuarach desert, and a Claw Bank from 
					Franklin, the merchant at Marvin's Wares (Magical). Yugio buys a scroll of disguise self.
				</p>
				<p class="Core">
					At the coachhouse Qautlz irritates the cleric and stable hand by asking about having 
					a two-humped horse for the wagon, since the sign for the coach house (Two Dollop Coachhouse)
					has a dromedary on it. Instead a pair of horses are provided, along with a covered wagon. Helme
					withdraws 120 sp, and 1 gp from the clawed hand.
				</p>
				<p class="Core">
					On their way to the mine, 8 days away, the party is attacked by shadows on the first night. Helm
					learns this is from the Claw Bank not being paid back and she decides to get out of debt after
					the shadows are easily killed. Once they get to the Lurkwood the party hustles and makes it to 
					the mine in the dark. The dwarves are wary but Qautlz drinks some silvered-water to prove they 
					are friends and the party is welcomed. 
				</p>
				<p class="Core">
					In the moring the party breakfasts with the dwarves and regail them with a tale of heroism. 
					After breakfast the party joins the dwarves in testing the new silvered weapons out on a 
					werewolf trapped behind a boulder in one of the passages. Dothmar slices it good and Helm 
					decides to devastate the wolf-man with nasty touch on the hand. Shortly after it falls to many
					blows from the dwarves. Quatzl sneaks off during the fight and hopes to find some drama or plunder 
					in the overseer Baldwin Slateface's chamber, but finds nothing of value except a copper award for 
					excellence from the Mirabar Miner's Guild. 
				</p>
				<p class="Core">
					The party now has to find the wood elves and get the sleeping drug, <i>haedrar</i> to 
					complete their tasks in Lurkwood.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section id="session13">
				<h3>Session 13: Melting the Chill</h3>
				<p class="Core">
					The gang decides to take on a mercenary group that double-crossed Broglyn known as "The Chill". 
					They learn that the group only accepts monstrous adventurers into their ranks, and that they
					hang at bar which sells powerful brews called Melanin's on the Third Below. The party picks 
					up an ally called Priscilla who knows the location of Melanin's and who want to be an adventurer.
				</p>
				<p class="Core">
					Finding the bar is no problem, but none of the monters are in at the moment. Quatzl, Dothmar, and Priscilla
					purchase expensive drinks at the bar, namely "Agonizing Birth of the Savior" and "Conceptual Purpose of Claude Fingers".
					No one loses their shit and all enjoy their heady beverages.
				</p>
				<p class="Core">
					Helm and Guinesse notice a minotaur head into the bar, as well as an elven woman with flaming hair, actually flaming. The 
					minotaur is tricked by a suggestion spell by Yugio to drink 10 gallons of constantly summoned water while Helm cockblocks
					Dothmar by insulting Blaize, the fire elf. Things get nasty and Blaize challenges Helm to a duel in the side alley. 
				</p>
				<p class="Core">
					Invisible Quatzl unloads a devstating amount of psychic pain into the quivering mind of Blaize, following up by 
					countering her fireball and thrusting her into the darkspace of hadar. The rest of the group shoots blindly into the 
					void except for Yugio who follows the now alarmed minotaur out toward the alley, and Priscilla who summons a weapon. 
				</p>
				<p class="Core">
					It isn't long before both members of the Chill are unconcious on the ground, with the last thing they hear being "Don't FUCK 
					with Broglyn". The group returns to Broglyn and decide to help him with another task, actually 2. They plan to head to the Lurkwood
					with silvered weapons and deliver them to Broglyn's friend who runs a mine, as well as steal headrar, and posion made by a tribe 
					of wood-elves in the Lurkwood. 	
				</p>
				<p class="Core">
					What awaits the group in Lurkwood? Death?
				</p>
			</section>
			<section id="session12">
				<h3>Session 12: To CATch a Predator</h3>
				<p class="Core">
					The battle is joined and the crew swap blows with Fentin and his saber-toothed pal.  Much pain is inflicted on 
					Quatzl as he probes the mind of Fentin, learning that Fentin is courting the snow cat and has it secured 
					in his room. During the fight Quatzl is scratched and one of his eyes turns cat-like for a moment, causing 
					Helm much concern. Finally Fentin is slain and a quick raid of his apartments yield the snow cat, a sack of coins, 
					and a wooden scepter with a cat head, apparently magical.
				</p>
				<p class="Core">
					Leaving and heading for Broglyn immediately, the group find their way back to the level above and deliver the cat,
					which has formed a bond with Quatzl. Helm learns from Broglyn that the dwarven temple to Moradin at the center of the 
					undercity is a likely place to cure Quatzl of his plight. Heading there the party trades the scepter for healing and then
					return to Broglyn where he agrees to help them with Obolo, if they help with clean up some <a href="handouts/mirabar.html">loose ends.</a>
				</p>
				<p class="Core">
					What tasks will the gang choose to do to help Broglyn... will they ever save Obolo's people?
				</p>
			</section>
			<section id="session11">
				<h3>Session 11: Cat Rescue Swat Squad</h3>
				<p class="Core">
					The gang follows the simpering half-orc (Nasshuk) to the lair of Fentin, and prepare an ambush. They learn from the frightened thug
					that there is only one sure way in or out of Fentin's pad, although there may be an passage that leads to the 
					sixth below hidden somewhere. Looking at the front entrance the group notes a sleeping half-orc sentinel against the door 
				    Listening at the door the Guinesie and Obolo surmise that 
					3 half-orcs are playing a game of chance at a table, and discussing the hardships of living as a "hork" in Mirabar.
				</p>
				<p class="Core">
					Yugio knocks at the door and is greeted by the hork who opens it, spits, then slams it in his face. Knocking again 
					Yugio weaves some magic into the room when the door is opened, destroying the cardgame and turning the tempers of the 
					hork thugs sourer. Battle begins and the horks attempt to block the door with a table but are quickly cut down 
					but powerful blows and arrows from the crew.
				</p>
				<p class="Core">
					As the last hork falls and they are checked for face-tattoos the door at the rear of the chamber crashes open from a 
					mighty boot-kick from an unmistakably tattooed orc. At his side an armored saber-tooth cat is poised, ready to pounce! What
					will happen next?
				</p>

					<h3>Session 10: Disguised Cat Rescue Squad</h3>
					<p class="dm"><Strong>DM:    </Strong>Wyatt</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The adventurer's meet with Broglyn at last who pays Quatzl, Helm, Dothmar and Guinesse 500 gp
						each for the return of the weapon crates from Grundl. Quatzl explains the circumstances
						of Grundl's collapse to Broglyn who is unsympathetic to Obolo's plea to rescue his people. 
						Talking with Broglyn more Quatzl gets him to agree to have a "more open mind" about helping 
						with Obolo, maybe he can act as burgomeister...  if the party will find a <span class="npc">"Snow Cat"</span> he has purchased that reminds him of his 
						departed freind and cousin. Broglyn even shows the party a portrait of the cat which is not 
						taken very seriously by the companions. Broglyn grumbles that he was insulted by the cat dealer who sent him 
						a letter soaked in cat piss telling him to "F off" in response to Broglyn's request that the cat be delivered.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						<span class="figure"><img src="media/images/broglins_cat.jpg" width="150 px" height="150 px"> The Cat Portrait</span>
						The party learns that the cat dealer who Broglyn commissioned to catch the cat is a half-orc ranger
						with a face tattoo named <span class="npc">Fentin</span>. Fentis is rumored to
						hide out at in dive called the <span class="location">Red Siren</span> on the level of the undercity below 
						Broglyn's level, that is the "Fifth Below". The entire region is supposed to house the more undesirable elements
						of Mirabar's dwarvern citenzenry. 
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						After resting a night in the apartments provided to them by Broglyn's merchant group (The Tower), the party 
						heads down to the Fifth Below in search of the Red Siren, they take along Redbeard Bronzebeard who claims to know
						the location of the Siren in exchange for one of the three tranquilizing syringes Broglyn gave the party for 
						use on his cat. Helm disguise's himself as a generic male bodyguard of Broglyn's, Yugio as Broglyn himself, and 
						Quatzl as a generic down-and-out dwarf. Guinesse does not use a magical disguise but travels in her cloak.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Redbeard leads the party around for a bit through the bustling beggar-ridden passages and smouldering smouldering 
						smouldering torches. Eventually the party finds the place... a brothel/tavern with red tinted kobolds
						acting as entertainers, servers, and least pleasingly, singers. Helm's no-nonsense attitude
						with the dwarf bouncers turns one of them on, and later she (disguised still as a bodygaurd) gets stabbed by a suspected associate of Fentin who leaves
						to go find Fentin and tell him Broglyn has shown up.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						A short while later 5 half-orc toughs show up to beat down the party but are quickly dispatched by spells and 
						arrows. The last standing thug is then mind tricked into returning to the party where he agrees to help 
						"Mr. Brog... Brogluin?" with finding Fentin's hidout. 
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						What awaits the party at Fentin's hideout? How big will the snow cat be?
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="session9">
					<h3>Session 9: Octopus (Squid) Cult and Mirabarran Reentry</h3>
					<p class="dm"><strong>DM:    </strong>Wyatt</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The party decides to return to Mirabar with Obolo and and hopefully get Broglyn to fund a 
						return trip to save Obolo's people. Before setting sail a corpse rises from amid the dead 
						sailors on the boat and demands Obolo come serve the mighty mage Frostberg, in exchange
						Frostberg will tell Obolo about his people. The party convinces Obolo to decline and 
						the corpse deanimates, plummeting into the river.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Sailing is smooth, with Dothmar manning the ship and directing the efforts of the 
						untrained party. As they near Mirabar however a cult of Octopus-worshipping dwarves
						attack the party, striking Yugio with a lightining bolt. A brief battle later the 
						cultists are dead, except for their leader who is interrogated and who yields little 
						information except that he servese the dread "<span class="npc">Druklin-Dulin</span>". During
						the battle the cultists had demanded 8 offerings, during the interrogation Qautlz asks for 
						clarification on what an offering is and learns that "Anything that sinks" would have been
						worthy. The party then decides to make an offering of this priest by Yugio conjuring a brick
						and tying it to him, Dothmar kicking him unconcious, Guinesse poking at his strange tattoo, general 
						abuse from Qautlz and Coen. Basically he is abused by everyone in the party except Helm before being 
						cast overboard. 
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Arriving at the small docks of Mirabar the party is boarded by an inspector who is dismayed
						to hear from Captain Dothmar (disguised as a non-Dothmar looking dwarf) that the "The crew is dead... we didn't do it!" Silence and confused
						answers lead this inspector, named Valdrin, to arrest the party for questioning. Fortunately
						Qatzl, who had also disguised himself and taken the Common Dwarf name Gimli Hardhammer had sent 
						word to Broglyn asking for a representive to get the party out of the inevitable jam they would find themselves
						in when reaching the docks. This representative arrives, an oily dwarf named Julio, and who gets the party
						to head off the ship and toward the jail, promising they are not going to be hassled much, he does this AFTER
						ensuring the the chests of weapons from Grundl are on the boat.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">On the way to the jail Quatzl awaits for a crowd to show  up and misty steps away, then
						returns in his normal form and the frustrated Valdrin lets the whole party go, warning that they are not
						to leave the city without his consent. Julio then takes the party down into the Undercity and 
						then to Broglyn's apartments.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Under the judging eyes of Broglyn's goons the party waits for an audience with Broglyn... how will 
						things go?
					</p>

				<section id="session8">
					<h3>Session 8: Dothmar's Fever Dream?</h3> 
					<p class="dm"><strong>DM:    </strong>Courtney</p>
					<p class="Core">
						A strange tale this time, the party finds themselves on the ocean and nearly out of food and water.
						They have just spotted land after months of water and are overjoyed! 
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Landing at once with expert sailer checks the group walks on the beach searching for food. A giant crab attacks 
						and provides an abundance of crab meat for the weary sailors. The party also spots a monkey in the jungle with
						monstrously sized trees that abuts the beach. After eating crab the party enters the jungle and the brave 
						Duradin approaches too close to the river and is abruptly attacked by a 30' land shark of uncertain anatomy (legs? fins?).
						Ten sea horses also leap back and forth from the river to the bank and harass the party while  they fight the shark.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The shark takes a large bite out of Duradin, who takes a beating from all the strange ocean-like river creatures that 
						seem intent on ending his life. Fortunately his allies help kill the shark and sea horses with arrows, axes, magic, and 
						more axes.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The party returns to the ship with fresh water and shark meat. After a long debate it is decided to return to the jungle 
						the following day.  On this day they come to a fork in the path that runs alongside the river, and choosing the left path
						come to a 100' tall wall. Debating if the wall was constructed by monkey-folk the party ventures around the side and see
						to their surprise 2 elven guards.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Hailing the guards the party learns that the city is very friendly and is an ancient safe place on this floating 
						mud 'island' that rests on a thin layer of earth and floats around the sea. That's why the sea monsters were in the river, 
						the ocean is right underneath!
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Entering the town and looking for a good time for Dothmar the group travels to the shady part of town, blowing off the
						guards who ask the party to stop at the town hall and register before exploring. The party spot is mediocre and Dothmar
						looks for a more fun experience, and is informed that a drug dealer will come in around 2 am.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The party waits it out and a awkward kid who looks like Eminem that no one thinks is cool except himself enters and 
						shyly offers the group a late night drinking soda. Frustrated the party finally learns from him that a group of 
						hard-core party people live out in the jungle and do drugs with their warrior friends keeping them mostly safe From
						death. Jumping at this opportunity the party follows the gangster outside the city wall after a tense moment with town 
						guard. 
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						As soon as they are in the jungle the party is attacked by bandits! Where are the goddam drugs? 
						Find out next time, maybe.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id=session7>
					<h3>Session 7: Polar Bears, Here? </h3>
					<p class="dm"><strong>DM:    </strong>Courtney</p>
					<p class='Core'>
						The group kills 6 polar bears and has a dope time. They make it back to the shpi and Yugio spends the rest of the 
						session dislodging the the tree from the side of the boat by casting remove earth repeatedly. He also casts mold earth
						to kindly craft clay limbs for the quadraplegic sailor.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="session6">
					<h3>Session 6: Krushing Krang's Gang</h3>
					<p class="dm"><strong>DM:    </strong>Wyatt</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Heading south to the trade boat Dothmar notices a fellow dwarf impaled on the front of the boat. 
						Guinesie and Yugio investigate while the rest of the party convinces Redbeard not to blow their 
						cover. The boat has more slain dwarves on deck, apparently squashed, a dwarf limb has been used
						as a writing tool for scrawling out the name "Krang Gang" in giant.  A tree has been pushed over 
						onto the boat and tracks of gnolls, a giant, some ogres, and several chests can be seen moving 
						away into the forest. The party debates for a time before heading onto the boat and finding one of the 
						dwarves is still alive. Helm revives him but he is in shock. Below decks the companions learn
						that 4 of their 8 chests of goods have been stolen!
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Opting to pursue the the theives the party travels into the forest. Soon they come upon the mashed bodies of 
						4 gnolls, a chest of loot, and one dead ogre. They hide the chest and continue following the tracks. 
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Reaching the base of a gentle slope the group catches wind of a foul odor, and is certain the theives
						are nearby. Reconnaissance reveals two ogres and a hill giant gathered around a gnoll roasting over 
						a fire. The party then plans a "flanking" manuever and charge down upon the monsters, slaying them 
						without much trouble.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The party has now recovered all the stolen chests, but they must get them back to the ship... or 
						maybe they'll do something else - who can tell? We'll find out next session!
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="session5">
					<h3>Session 5: Meeting Obolo</h3>
					<p class="dm"><strong>DM:    </strong>Wyatt</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Yugio hopes to find tresure amongst the toads but decides against digging through the shit pit
						where they disgorge all the undigestables they consume. A blue skinned orc claw his way out of one of the slain 
						toads and introduces himself as <span class="npc">Obolo</span>, cheif of Grundl. The companions speak with
						him and convince him to return to Grundl with them.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						On the way out of the chasm an albino raven with an petulent female blue orc head lands above the party and heckles them.
						Her taunting reveals that she is Obolo's sister, <span class="npc">Witchita</span>, and that she is appentice to local 
						sorcerer name <span class="npc">Frostberg</span>.  Guinesie and Qautlz quickly tire of her boasting and blast her. She flees 
						and shortly after a bizzare jellyfish-like floating creature attacks the party, badly wounding Qatzl before being destroyed.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Getting back to town is easy with Obolo as a guide, and the party discovers that the town is deserted - except for 
						several ogre and gnoll maruaders and an insane Findl. Yugio releases Findl from his cell and watches as he rushes 
						out of town and onto the ledge. In a panic Findl cries out that he has "missed the great migration, no, never, there
						is still time!", then Findl leaps from the ledge and plunges to his death in the river below.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Back outside of town the group exchanges some telegrams with an irate <span class="npc">Broglin</span> who wants 
						mentions that the trade boat is docked an hour south of town.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="session4">
					<h3>Session 4: Toad Trouble</h3>
					<p class="dm"><strong>DM:    </strong>Wyatt</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Just outside of town, surrounded by the mob of raptururous villagers, the party decides the best thing to do is leave to look 
						for Obolo. Before leaving Yugio wants to see Malfred naked and skillfully rips away his clothing - there is little to see 
						however. Qautlz then throws down a leaf that sprouts into a massive oak, sending Malfred up into the air of its branches.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Redbeard Bronzebeard is able to lead the party to the chasm of the ice toads. Coen take the form of a small ice toad 
						and enters the cave but chokes when one of the 8 toads in the cave abruptly asks her "What Tribe?". A battle ensues with Coen
						being nearly killed by the toad bites, and Yugio being breifly consumed.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						After the fray, with the toads all slain, the companions notice the mightest of the toads is still moving. Someone appears to 
						be crawling out of its mouth!
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="session3">
					<h3>Session 3: Assisting Malfred</h3>
					<p class="dm"><strong>DM:    </strong>Wyatt</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Traveling out to the promontory where Malfred asked them to go, the companions witness the orc incanting. Soon a wrathful water elemental
						is summoned and the party begrudgingly aids him against it. As soon as the elemental is destroyed another composed of air takes its place,
						and then one of earth, and finally one of fire. With these four forces destroyed Malfred thanks the party and asks them to return with him
						as heroes to Grundl.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						A crowd of fifty orcish tradespeople meet the party and Malfred a quarter mile outside of town and Malfred introduces the party to the crowd
						favorably. The faces of the assembled townfolk are eerily blissful. The party is uneasy.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="session2">
					<h3>Session 2: Who's Who in Grundl</h3>
					<p class="dm"><strong>DM:    </strong>Wyatt</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The party meets with several local VIP's including <span class="npc">Findl</span>, the towns gnomish burgomeister and head 
						of finance; <span class="npc">Malfred</span>, a charismatic orc seeking to free the town's working class from the oppression 
						of Findl. They also learn about the town's absent cheif, <span class="npc">Obolo</span>, who is currently out meditating
						with toads. This is soon taken to mean "frolicking in the forest" by the party.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						During the exchange of seafood for Grundl's arms and armor a crate of sea urchins is discovered missing. The party 
						bullies one of the ship workers to find out a local chef is planning to create a delicious meal out of them. Traveling
						to the home of the chef the party is surprised by him leaping out of a window - but they soon capture him and recover almost
						all of the urchins.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The group then decides to visit Malfred on the following day to witness his miracle of nature outside of town.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Session 1: Reaching Grundl</h3>
					<p class="dm"><strong>DM:    </strong>Wyatt</p>
					<p class="Core">
						The companions have beat down the hobgoblins that attacked the ship and continue along the River Surbin toward <span class="location">Grundl</span>,
						town of unusually industrious orcs. A few days later the river becomes partially frozen and two <span class="npc">Yeti</span> leap from
						a neaby tree into the boat. One yeti is a red-bellied and the other is blue-bellied. The party murders them both and harvests them for 
						craklins, horn aphrodisiacs, and fur. Qatzl sells the captain of the ship some urine as an aphrodisiac.
					</p>
					<p class="Core">
						Arriving in Grundl, the companions find board at <span class="location">Curler's Inn</span>, where they meet a drunken dwarf named
						Redbeard Bronzebeard as well as Curlers. The orc proprietor missing one of two lower tusks (the remaining tusk has a fine curl). 
						Dothmar attempts to seduce a cloaked female and is viciously stabbed by her. The companions attack her until she lays dead and discover
						she is terribly scarred and her lips are sewn shut.
